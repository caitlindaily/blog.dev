##My Blog and Personal Website

This was a major project I started while in the Codeup bootcamp. It entails my own personal website that connects to a portfolio page, resume page, links to my Github, Twitter and LinkdIn, and also my blog area. This was my first time using a framework and I leanred how everything connects from a request all the way to the database.

This project was created using the MVC framework Laravel 4.2.
The languages used include *PHP*, *JQuery*, *HTML*, and *CSS*.
